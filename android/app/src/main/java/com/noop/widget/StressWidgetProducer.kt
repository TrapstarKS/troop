/**
 * Scores today's hourly stress for the widget, and does it as rarely as it can get away with.
 *
 * THE GATE IS THE POINT. Scoring a day means reading today's heart rate, R-R and gravity, three
 * unioned reads bounded at 200 000 rows each, which is the same work the Stress screen does when you
 * open it. The screen does that once, on a deliberate act. A widget producer sits on a periodic tick,
 * and putting three reads of that size on a repeating cadence is precisely the pattern this codebase
 * has had to unpick before (the analyze-pass storm, and the 21-night re-score behind it).
 *
 * So no samples are read until [WhoopRepository.stressFingerprintUnion] says a scored stream moved.
 * The witness covers measured and PPG-derived HR, R-R and gravity over the same source ids as the reads.
 * An idle tick costs index aggregates and returns the previous curve without decoding any samples.
 *
 * SCORING MODE. Background callers keep the DayRelative default: resolving the personal lens reads
 * trailing days of heart rate, a cost a foreground screen can afford and an unprompted tick cannot.
 * Today's hosted card passes its selected foreground lens explicitly, so it agrees with Stress detail;
 * the home-screen widget does not opt in and remains a deliberately cheaper background surface.

     *    what the early stamp exists to prevent.
     *  - a placed widget whose read came back null: rewind so the next attempt is [retryMs] away rather
     *    than a full interval. Not zero, because the other half of the caller's reasoning is that a
     *    failing pass must not retry on the very next sample; a short floor honours both.
     *  - [widgetPlaced] NULL, the host did not answer: rewind as well, and this is the case the report is
     *    really about. The placement check fails closed, so a transient miss arrives as the same `false`
     *    a settled no does, and spending the interval on it leaves a placed widget blank.
